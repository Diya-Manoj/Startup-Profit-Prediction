## Problem Statement 
Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data. We will be predicting the profit from the startup's dataset with the features available to us. 
We're using the 50-startups dataset for this problem statement and we will be using the concept of Multiple linear regression to predict the profit of startups companies. 
This machine learning model will be quite helpful in such a situation where we need to find a profit based on how much we are spending in the market and for the market.
